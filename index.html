                ABBA is a Swedish pop band that was formed in 1972. The name of the band is an acronym that represents each of their first names. <br>
                Two years after the group was formed, they won the Eurovision Song Contest of 1974. This was not only the first time that Sweden had <br>
                won this competition, but ABBA went on to become the most successful music group to ever win.

                In 1982, about 10 years after the group formed, personal issues between the members lead to the disbanding of the group. <br>
                The group was made up of two married couples, Anni-Frid and Benny, as well as Agneta and Björn. As their popularity skyrocketed, <br>
                the members decided that it was too difficult to handle their music careers and marriages in tandem. Björn and Agenta got divorced <br>
                in 1980, followed a year later by the divorce of Benny and Anni-Frid
